# LocalAutonomousAgent

This might become an attempt at an autonomous agent that runs locally through LMS servers with multiple, different, local LLMs ran simultaneously. But I'm also not a dev and have never created a repo before so I have no ideea what I'm doing. All I know is that all other local implememntatons of AAs suck because the prompts are tailored and tested for OpenAI API
